# Intermittent Tailwind Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where styles defined using Tailwind classes fail to apply to certain components after the build process.  The issue is intermittent and appears to be linked to the structure of particular components. This bug occurs only sometimes, making debugging difficult.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the build process (e.g., `npm run build`).
3. Observe that some components may lack expected styling from Tailwind classes, while others apply correctly.
4. Rebuild the project. The failing components might work this time.

## Potential Causes

This bug could originate from several sources, including:

* **Webpack Configuration:** Incorrect webpack configuration could lead to inconsistent class application. This is unlikely, but should be investigated.
* **Build Process:** Issues within the build process itself might interfere with Tailwind's post-processing.  This is also unlikely but should be checked.
* **Component Structure:** It may be some very particular component structure not being handled correctly by the tailwindcss processor.
* **Tailwind Configuration:** Incorrect configuration settings can lead to unexpected style behaviors.
